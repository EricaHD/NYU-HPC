# NYU High Performance Computing (HPC)

An example of how I use NYU's high performance computing system from on and off campus.
- Logging in, submitting/monitoring/canceling normal sbatch jobs  
- Using Jupyter notebooks  
- Secure copying  

This repository contains .md files with instructions as well as sample .sbatch files.
